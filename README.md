# Basic Overview
School project demonstrating the concept of AI therapy; an already existing product, but wished to be improved on by some kids at BHS.

# How it Works
This project's foundation begins with Python flask supporting the webserver. Upon recieving a request from a user regarding AI, it would utilize the Brainshop.ai to handle all of the AI related functions.

# Improvements Required for Commercial Use
A properly trained AI by professionals would greatly increase customer satisfaction and remove a possibility for failure. A design overhaul would also be required to ease the user experience and to better render for multiple platforms.
