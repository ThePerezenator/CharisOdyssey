# Basic Overview
This was a school project demonstrating the concept of AI therapy; an already existing product, but wished to be improved on by some kids at BHS. The code is pretty basic and not the best, but as stated before, it is just a demonstration which was made with no proper education in this career field. 

# How it Works
This project's foundation begins with a Python flask webserver. Upon receiving a request from a user, it would utilize the Brainshop.ai to handle all of the AI related functions and return to the user.

# Improvements Required for Commercial Use
A properly trained AI by professionals would greatly increase customer satisfaction and remove a point of failure. A design overhaul would also be required to ease the user experience and to better render for multiple platforms.
